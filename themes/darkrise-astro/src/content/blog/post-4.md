We like to think we’re good at spotting lies. But the truth is, even the most informed people fall for misinformation.

At Misinformant, we spend a lot of time analyzing how misinformation spreads. However, it is just as important to understand why people believe it in the first place. It’s not just about what’s said. It’s about how we think, how we feel, and how information is framed.

Here are a few reasons misinformation sticks and why it’s so hard to shake once it does.

#### Our Brains Like Shortcuts

Your brain is constantly trying to make sense of the world with limited time and attention. So it takes shortcuts called cognitive biases to help process information quickly. These shortcuts are useful, but they also make you vulnerable to false or misleading claims.

For example, confirmation bias makes you more likely to believe things that support what you already think while Availability bias makes you overestimate how true or common something is just because it’s easy to remember or dramatic.

This means that a lie, repeated often or framed in the right way, can feel “true enough.”.

#### Emotions Beat Facts

People don’t process information logically first. They feel it. If something makes you scared, angry, or validated, you're more likely to believe it and then share it.

Misinformation is designed to provoke emotion. It’s fast, attention-grabbing, and framed to trigger a reaction. That emotional reaction creates a kind of imprint that facts often can’t override.

By the time a correction comes along, the emotional weight of the original lie has already done the damage.

#### Repetition Works

One of the most powerful ways misinformation spreads is through repetition. Say something often enough (even if it’s false) and people start to believe it. Psychologists call this the illusory truth effect.

Repetition creates familiarity. And in the absence of clear, trusted information, familiarity starts to feel like truth.

#### Social Proof Fuels Trust

People tend to believe what those around them believe. If your friends, family, or favorite influencer shares something, you're more likely to trust it regardless of whether it's accurate.

Misinformation moves quickly in social circles. Once it takes hold in a community or group, it becomes part of the conversation. That social validation makes it harder to question, even when the facts say otherwise.

#### Information Overload Leaves Gaps

There’s too much information online and not enough time to verify it all. That overload makes people more likely to accept what seems plausible, especially when they’re tired, distracted, or overwhelmed.

Bad actors count on that. They don’t need you to fully believe a lie. They just need to create enough confusion or doubt to weaken trust in legitimate sources.

#### What We Can Do About It

At Misinformant, we believe that addressing misinformation means going beyond fact-checking. It means understanding how misinformation is designed to work and how our brains react to it.

That’s why we’re building a platform that doesn’t just identify falsehoods but also explains where they came from, how they spread, and what the verified truth looks like. You can’t fight misinformation with facts alone. You need context, clarity, and tools that help people think critically in the moment.
