IIf you’ve been online long enough, you probably remember Clippy, the paperclip “assistant” from old versions of Microsoft Office. Clippy was supposed to help, but mostly just popped up with uninvited advice. For many, he became the face of tech frustration.

So why is Louis Rossmann suggesting we all change our profile pictures to Clippy? On the surface, it seems like a joke. But it really is a movement of people protesting companies for their unfair digital practices and data exploitation.

#### Who Is Louis Rossmann?

Louis Rossmann is a repair advocate, small business owner, and outspoken critic of big tech practices. He built a reputation running a repair shop in New York City and posting videos explaining everything from fixing Apple products to calling out corporate policies that limit consumer rights. Over the years, his YouTube channel has become a hub for tech commentary, free repair education, and sharp takes on how technology affects everyday life.

When someone like Rossmann tells you to make Clippy your profile picture, it is not just trolling. It is part of his broader style: challenging norms, encouraging people to think critically, and adding humor to conversations about technology.

#### Why Clippy?

Clippy's software wasn't attempting to steal your personal information or persuade you to buy more Microsoft products, nor was he going to use the fact that you were having a rough day to try and choose which advertiser to sell you to. He had no hidden agenda. He was designed only to be there to help.

In contrast to many software programs like Adobe or Intuit, they are not even available for purchase. Video editors are now available only through subscription. If you wanted to launch Microsoft Word on a machine that hasn't been used in twenty-eight years, you could do it without connecting to the internet and Clippy would still be there.

It seems like a lot of people took Clippy for granted, considering what companies are using their software for now.

"If you're tired of companies that have the ability to reach into your house and ransomware your products so that they stop working unless you pay them again, claiming that that's legal, but then when somebody tries to give you back access to what you bought and pay for, change your profile photo to a Clippy," states Rossman.

#### Why Misinformant Supports the Movement

Misinformant supports this form of digital activism. Changing your profile picture to is now a symbolic act of resistance against data exploitation, unfair digital practices, and the hidden monetization of personal experiences.

The way we see it, Clippy isn’t just a silly little paperclip. He is now a symbol of resistance, digital accountability, and the collective power of users standing up for their rights online thanks to Louis Rossman.
